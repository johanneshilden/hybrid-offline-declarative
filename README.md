# Hybrid, offline and declarative

## Hybrid mobile web apps

Hybrid mobile web applications behave more like native apps, but are created using our everyday web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). These applications run inside a native WebView container on the target device. From normal users' perspective, this means little or no difference in terms of overall experience. You find these applications in app stores online and install them to your device just like any other app. For application developers, these technologies offer some important advantages over vendor-proprietary SDKs. In particular, web technologies are

* already familiar to most developers, or otherwise easy to learn;
* inherently cross-platform; and
* founded on open standards.

UX designers can leverage their existing web design skills and rely on comprehensive CSS toolkits (e.g. [http://getbootstrap.com/](Twitter Bootstrap)) to build sophisticated and highly interactive user interfaces with modern, responsive features. For businesses, the advantage is that their development team can target more than one platform, which means a single code base to maintain.

The overall trend today is that more and more applications run either in the browser, or in a browser-like environment. Language technologies are quickly adapting to keep up with this new reality. Compilers and other build tools are already capable of producing code that runs in legacy browsers and performs well even on low-end devices. In fact, modern JavaScript runtimes have performance characteristics comparable to native code execution.

Although there may be capabilities unique to a specific device which are unavailable using the hybrid app approach, plugins and native APIs can be utilized to target most platform-specific requirements.

Some questions to consider before making (taking) the decision to develop a hybrid app:

* What are the target devices?
* What does the development team's skill set look like?
* What capabilities of the device does the application need to utilize?
